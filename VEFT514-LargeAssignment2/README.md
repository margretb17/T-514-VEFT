## Mansion de Subastas
You have been hired as a lead developer for an art-selling company called Mansion de Subastas.
They are obsessed with NodeJS and will not accept anything else as their tech stack. Along with
NodeJS they want ExpressJS, MongoDB (with Mongoose). As always failure is not an option,
these artist sellers demand perfection!

### Rules
#### This applies for all routes:
  •If a resource is not found, the web service should always return a status code 404

  •In POST requests which include ids from another resource, the ids should be validated by checking if they exist. If they don’t exist   the web service should return a status code 400

  •If an error occurs on the database level, the web service should return a status code 500

  •There is not model validation required for this assignment

### Functionality (80%)
#### Routes (all route declarations should reside in index.js)

  •(2.5%) /api/arts [GET] - Gets all arts

  •(2.5%) /api/arts/:id [GET] - Gets an art by id

  •(5%) /api/arts [POST] - Creates a new art (see how model should look like in Model section)

  •(2.5%) /api/artists [GET] - Gets all artists

  •(2.5%) /api/artists/:id [GET] - Gets an artist by id

  •(5%) /api/artists [POST] - Creates a new artist (see how model should look like in Model section)

  •(2.5%) /api/customers [GET] - Gets all customers

  •(2.5%) /api/customers/:id [GET] - Gets a customer by id

  •(5%) /api/customers [POST] - Creates a new customer (see how model should look like in Model section)

  •(2.5%) /api/customers/:id/auction-bids [GET] - Gets all auction bids associated with a customer

  •(2.5%) /api/auctions [GET] - Gets all auctions

  •(2.5%) /api/auctions/:id [GET] - Gets an auction by id

  •(5%) /api/auctions/:id/winner [GET] - Gets the winner of the auction. If the auction is not finished the web service should return a     status code 409 (Conflict), otherwise it should return the customer which holds the highest bid. If the auction had no bids, it
    should return a status code 200 (OK) with the message: ‘This auction had no bids.’.

  • (5%) /api/auctions [POST] - Create a new auction (see how model should look like in Model section). The art id provided within the      body must be a valid art id with its property isAuctionItem set to true. If the isAuctionItem is set to false, the web service          should return a status code 412 (Precondition failed). Also if there is an ongoing auction currently for this art, the web service      should return a status code 409 (Conflict).
  
  • (2.5%) /api/auctions/:id/bids [GET] - Gets all auction bids associated with an
    auction
    
  • (10%) /api/auctions/:id/bids [POST] - Creates a new auction bid (see how model
    should look like in Model section). Auction bids must be higher than the minimum
    price and must also be higher than the current highest bid. If the auction bid price is
    lower than the minimum price or current highest bid, the web service should return a
    status code 412 (Precondition failed). If the auction has already passed its end date,
    the web service should return a status code 403 (Forbidden). As a side-effect the
    auctionWinner property in the Auction schema should be updated to the latest
    highest bidder.
    
  • (5%) Services (all service implementations should reside in services/ folder for each
    corresponding service)
    
  • artService - Should be used to get data from the database using the schema Art and
    tailor the data according to the endpoints needs
    
  • artistService - Should be used to get data from the database using the schema
    Artist and tailor the data according to the endpoints needs
    
  • auctionService - Should be used to get data from the database using the schemas
    Auction and AuctionBids and tailor the data according to the endpoints needs
    
  • customerService - Should be used to get data from the database using the schema
    Customer and tailor the data according to the endpoints needs
    
  • (10%) Schemas (all Mongoose schemas should be declared within schemas/ folder). The
    red asterisk means that the field is required.
    
  • Art - title* (String), artistId* (ObjectId), date* (Date, defaults to now), images (A list of
    String), description (String), isAuctionItem (Boolean, defaults to false)
    
  • Artist - name* (String), nickname* (String), address* (String), memberSince* (Date,
    defaults to now)
    
  • Auction - artId* (ObjectId), minimumPrice (Number, defaults to 1000), endDate*
    (Date), auctionWinner (ObjectId, which should be a valid id of a customer, which
    holds the highest bid)
    
  • AuctionBid - auctionId* (ObjectId), customerId* (ObjectId), price* (Number) 
  
  • Customer - name* (String), username* (String), email* (String), address* (String)
  
  • (5%) Database (database connection should reside within data/ folder)
  
  • db.js - The connection to the database should be setup within this folder and
    connected to the schemas. The schemas should then be exported from this file.
    
### Structure (20%)
  • The solution must be implemented using Node with ExpressJS
  
  • (10%) The solution must make use of MongoDB with Mongoose to retrieve/store data
  
  • (5%) The solution should be modular and follow the SRP principle, what this means is that
  
    it should follow the directory structure seen in the Folder structure section below
    
  • (5%) All packages should be installed using either NPM or Yarn and they should be
    tracked within package.json
